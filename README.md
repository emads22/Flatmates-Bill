# Flatmates Bill

## Overview
Flatmates Bill is a Python application designed to fairly split the utility bill among flatmates based on the number of days they stayed in the house during the billing period. The application is built using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept to enhance modularity and maintainability.

## Features
- **Bill Calculation**: Calculate the share of the bill each flatmate needs to pay based on their days of stay.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Generate a PDF report summarizing the bill details and each flatmate's share.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensure that user inputs are correctly formatted and valid.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
4. Install the required dependencies using:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Configure the necessary parameters in `constants.py`.
   - Edit `constants.py` to set any required constants for the project.

## Usage
1. Run the script using:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. Follow the prompts to enter the total bill amount, bill period, and each flatmate's name and days stayed.
3. The script will calculate and print each flatmate's share of the bill.
4. A PDF report will be generated summarizing the bill details and each flatmate's share.
